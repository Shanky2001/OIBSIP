                    <p class="para1">Without the contributions of many brilliant brains, the world of video games would not have undergone the major changes it has throughout the years. Ralph H. Baer, generally referred to as the father of video games, stands out among these outstanding brains.</p>
                        <h1 class="header2"> About his Life</h1>
                        <p class="para2">Engineer and inventor Ralph Henry Baer, also known as Rudolf Heinrich Baer, was born in Germany and is known as the "Father of the Video Game." Baer, who was born in Germany's southwest in 1922, grew up during Hitler time.

                            He and his family escaped to the United States in 1938 because of being Jewish, and he eventually became a citizen.
                            
                            Baer enrolled in a radio technician course at the National Radio Institute to pursue his passion in electronics. He obtained employment managing multiple radio service shops in New York City after completing the advanced course there in 1940, where he used his training to maintain all varieties of home and automobile radios. He enlisted in the American army in 1943 and spent World War II stationed overseas in France working in military intelligence. Following the war, Baer utilised the G.I. Bill to enrol at the American Television College of Technology in Chicago. After earning his Bachelor of Science in Television Engineering in 1949, he continued to work as an engineer on a regular basis.

                            Baer joined Sanders Associates, Inc., a defence contractor based in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1956. (now a part of BAE Systems, Inc.). Baer was instrumental in the creation of electronic technologies for use in military applications when he was there. He remained employed at Sanders until he retired in 1987.</p>

                    <h1 class="header3">His Achievements</h1>

                    <p class="para3">While employed at Sanders,  Baer first started to explore the possibility playing games on television screens. With the reduction in TV prices, he saw a market opportunity for applications outside of standard television program viewing. In 1966, Baer wrote a proposal to convince his supervisors at Sanders to allow him to move forward with pursuing the concept. He was given $2,500 and the time of two other engineers, Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch. Together, they developed the first commercial gaming unit, the “Brown Box Console.” Later renamed the Magnavox Odyssey, the console was released to the public in 1972.

                        Baer went on to develop and patent several other hardware prototypes, consoles and consumer game units, including the electronic pattern-matching game Simon. Simon and its sequel, Super Simon, remained immensely popular in the U.S. through the late 1990s.
                        
                        Through these inventions, Baer formed a foundation for virtual technology used by the military and like industries to this day. His contributions to innovation changed not only the home entertainment experience, but also Sanders’ path for interactive technologies for military applications.
                        
                        Even after retirement, Baer continued to innovate and invent. In a 2013 NPR interview, Baer compared his need to create to that of a painter, describing it as a desire he could not control and should not cease, as he always saw challenges to be solved. He worked in his basement lab, filled with toys and inventions to inspire him, until his death in December 2014. He has 150 patents to his name.
